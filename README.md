## Sentiment Classification on MOvie Review Dataset
This repository contains the implementation of a sentence-level sentiment classification system built on top of pretrained word embeddings such as Word2Vec and GloVe. The project explores standard Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning architectures ‚Äî including **RNN, CNN, BiLSTM, and BiGRU** ‚Äî to effectively assign sentiment labels to sentences.

To further enhance model performance, we also experimented with **Ensemble** methods, combining predictions from multiple models to achieve more robust results.

## üìå Abstract
The goal of this project is to build a general-purpose text classification system using pretrained word embeddings, with a focus on **sentiment classification**. This serves as a hands-on exercise in:
- Applying pretrained word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
- Building and training deep learning models for sentence classification
- Evaluating classifier performance on sentiment analysis tasks

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Pretrained Embedding Integration: Leverages pretrained Word2Vec and GloVe vectors.
- Model Architectures: Includes implementations of typical deep learning models such as:
    - Simple Feedforward Networks
    - RNN / LSTM / GRU-based models
    - CNN-based models for sentence classification
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
- Training & Validation: Includes scripts for model training, validation, and performance tracking.
