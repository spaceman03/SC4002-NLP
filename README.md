## Description
### Welcome to our group project on Natural Language Processing (SC4002).

In this project, we cover Dataset Preparation to generate our Word Embeddings, as well as exploring different methods to resolve Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words. After which, we explored the accuracies of the various neural networks (RNN, CNN, biLSTM, biGRU) with different hyperparameters to achieve the highest accuracy score. Lastly, we touched on additional methods, such as Ensemble, to further improve our model.


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
As the project is run using Python, please ensure that Python 3.12 is installed in your device.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/eddy-ckq/SC4002_NLP.git
    cd SC4002_NLP
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open and run `SC4002_G10_Word2vec_backoff.ipynb` within the Jupyter interface.
